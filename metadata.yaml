description: The Feast at Solhaug (or in the original Norwegian Gildet paa Solhoug)
  is the first publicly successful drama by Henrik Ibsen. It was written in 1855 and
  had its premier at Det norske Theater in Bergen on January 2, 1856. Part of the
  strength and charm of this play as well as Ibsen's other early poetic works results
  from the style of the poetic form and the inherent melody of the old ballads for
  those who speak Scandinavian languages.-- Excerpted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
